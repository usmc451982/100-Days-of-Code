#Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height

#Don't change the code below
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
#Don't change the code above

#Write your code below this line

weight_as_int = int(weight)
height_as_float = float(height)

# Using the exponent operator **
bmi = weight_as_int / height_as_float ** 2
# or using multiplication and PEMDAS
bmi = weight_as_int / (height_as_float * height_as_float)

bmi_as_int = int(bmi)

print(bmi_as_int)
