#Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.

#Don't change the code below
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))
#Don't change the code above

#Write your code below this line

# number % 2

#if number == 0:
#    print("This is an even number.")
#else:
#    print("This is an odd number.")

#Placed the %2 in the wrong place but understood the concept

if number % 2 == 0:
    print("This is an even number.")
else:
    print("This is an odd number.")
